# Versions

Versions is a super-simple library for comparing version numbers.

## Usage

```clojure
(use boxuk.versions)

(later-version? "1.0.0" "1.0.1") ; true
(later-version? "2.1.0" "1.2.0") ; false

(earlier-version? "1.0.0" "0.0.9" ) ; true
(earlier-version? "0.9.0" "0.9.1" ) ; false
```

# Caveats

Currently versions only handles numerical versions, it does not take into
account formats like release candidates, or beta/alpha strings, etc...
